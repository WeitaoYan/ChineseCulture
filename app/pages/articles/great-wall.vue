        <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Ever heard that you can see the Great Wall from space? While that's
          more legend than fact, the truth behind it is even more remarkable:
          this is a human-made structure so vast, so ancient, it stretches
          beyond the horizon and deep into history. To the world, it's China's
          most iconic symbol. To the Chinese, it's the enduring spine of our
          civilization—a stone ribbon woven with tales of defense, perseverance,
          and cultural exchange.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Built over 2,000 years across several dynasties to protect the ancient
          empires, the Wall isn't a single, continuous line. Think of it more as
          a <strong>collection of regional walls and fortifications</strong>,
          with the sections built during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) being the
          most famous and best-preserved. Today, it's not just a monument to the
          past; it's a living trail where millions walk each year to touch
          history and witness breathtaking landscapes.

          🏯 Badaling: The Classic Grand Introduction
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          If you've ever seen a picture of the Great Wall, it was likely
          <strong>Badaling</strong>. As the most famous and easily accessible
          section (about 1.5 hours from Beijing), it offers the classic,
          postcard-perfect view.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Here, the Wall is
          <strong
            >wide, solid, and snakes powerfully over the rugged mountain
            ridges</strong
          >. The views are sweeping and give you that awe-inspiring feeling of
          standing on top of the world. It's fully restored, which means the
          walking paths are clear and safe, making it a great choice for
          families and those with limited time. Be prepared for crowds,
          especially on weekends and holidays—going early in the morning is the
          best trick to enjoy a moment of quiet with this ancient wonder.

          ⚔️ Juyongguan: Step Inside a Living Fortress
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Located just south of Badaling, <strong>Juyongguan</strong> is a
          completely different experience. This isn't just a wall on a mountain;
          it's a <strong>massive, fully enclosed fortress</strong> built to seal
          off a crucial mountain pass.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          As you enter the imposing gate, you step back into a Ming Dynasty
          military stronghold. You can walk a complete
          <strong>loop</strong> along the walls that encircle the valley, giving
          you a soldier's-eye view of the defenses. The climb here is steep and
          demanding, but it rewards you with an incredible understanding of how
          the Wall functioned as an integrated system of walls, gates, and
          garrisons. Don't miss the beautiful <strong>Cloud Platform</strong>, a
          14th-century marble archway inside the pass, carved with detailed
          Buddhist figures and inscriptions in six languages.

          ⛰️ Mutianyu: Where the Wall Meets Natural Beauty
        </h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          For many visitors and photographers, <strong>Mutianyu</strong> (about
          2 hours from Beijing) is the perfect balance. It combines
          well-preserved architecture with some of the
          <strong>most spectacular scenery</strong> of any section.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          The Wall here winds like a dragon's spine over mountains thick with
          pine and cypress trees, offering stunning views in every season—lush
          green in summer, fiery hues in autumn, and serene white in winter.
          It's significantly <strong>less crowded</strong> than Badaling,
          allowing for a more peaceful walk. A unique feature is the
          <strong>Zhengguantai watchtower</strong>, where three towers stand
          connected on a single platform. For an easier ascent or a fun descent,
          you can take a <strong>cable car up</strong> and, famously,
          <strong>slide down on a toboggan</strong>!

              connection. It linked armies, transmitted messages, and witnessed
              the silent exchange of goods and ideas across its formidable
              stones.
