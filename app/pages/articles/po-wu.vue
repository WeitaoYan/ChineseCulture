        <p class="section-text">
          After days of feasting, family gatherings, and well-wishes, Chinese
          New Year celebrations reach a powerful climax on the
          <strong>fifth day of the first lunar month</strong>. This day is
          called <strong>Po Wu</strong> (破五), which literally means
          <strong>"Breaking Five."</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          If the first four days of the New Year are about welcoming good
          fortune and honoring traditions, Po Wu is the day when things get real
          again. It's the moment when the holiday's "rules" are broken,
          businesses reopen, and families take decisive action to send away any
          lingering bad luck.

          In 2026, when the Year of the Horse begins on February 17, Po Wu will

        <p class="section-text">
          This day has two main purposes, and they're beautifully connected:
          <strong>sending out poverty and bad luck</strong>, and
          <strong>welcoming back wealth and normal life</strong>.
        </p>
        <FeatureGrid>
          <FeatureItem title="Mission 1: Sweeping Out the 'Poor'" theme="gold">
            <p>
              For the first four days of the New Year, there's a strict rule:
              <strong>no sweeping</strong>. Why? Because you don't want to
              accidentally sweep away the good luck that just arrived with the
              New Year. Dust and trash are allowed to pile up, preserving the
              household's fresh fortune.
            </p>
            <p>
              But by the fifth day, all that accumulated trash has taken on a
              new meaning. It now represents <strong>"poor energy"</strong> —
              the lingering shadow of last year's hardships. So on Po Wu,
              families finally grab their brooms and
              <strong>clean house with purpose</strong>.

            <p>
              Once the "poor" is out, there's space to welcome something better.
              Po Wu is the day to
              <strong>greet Cai Shen, the God of Wealth</strong>, with open
              arms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many families perform small ceremonies to invite prosperity into
              their freshly cleaned homes. Offerings of fruit, sweets, and
              incense are placed facing the direction believed to be the god's
              arrival point. The sound of <strong>firecrackers</strong> fills
              the air—not just for celebration, but to get the god's attention
              and announce, "We're ready for you here!"

        <p class="section-text">
          This isn't gentle tidying. It's a
          <strong>thorough, symbolic sweep</strong>. Trash is gathered and
          thrown out decisively, sometimes accompanied by firecrackers. The
          message is clear: poverty and misfortune are being physically expelled
          from the home. In some traditions, people even write the character for
          "poor" (穷) on paper and tear it up or burn it during the cleaning.

              The cleaning on Po Wu is more than just housekeeping—it's a
              spiritual act of purification. Every corner is swept with
              intention, symbolically removing negative energy from the past
              year.

              The collected waste is disposed of carefully, often in a way that

              public place rather than the household bin.

        <p class="section-text">
          Like every important Chinese festival, Po Wu has its special food:
          <strong>dumplings (饺子)</strong>. But these aren't just any

              When you make dumplings, you pinch the edges shut. This action is
              said to represent "<strong

          You'll notice that Po Wu traditions often involve
          <strong>loud noises</strong>. Firecrackers are set off throughout the
          day, especially in business districts and residential courtyards.
          There are two reasons for this:

          A Regional Twist: The Northern-Southern Divide

          Just like with other festivals, there's a regional difference in how
          Po Wu is celebrated.

        <FeatureGrid>
          <FeatureItem title="Northern China" theme="gold">
            <p>
              In <strong>Northern China</strong>, Po Wu is a big deal. The
              sweeping ritual, the dumpling feast, and the firecrackers are all
              observed with enthusiasm.

              In some <strong>Southern regions</strong>, the fifth day is less
              emphasized. Instead, some communities celebrate "Welcoming the God
              of Wealth" on the fourth day. But everywhere, the idea is the
              same: by the fifth day, the New Year's "rules" begin to loosen,
              and daily life starts its return.

        <h2 class="section-title">The Deeper Meaning: A Fresh Start</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          At its heart, Po Wu is about
          <strong>closure and new beginnings</strong>. It acknowledges that
          while the first days of the New Year are sacred and special, life must
          eventually move forward. The piled-up trash must go. The closed shops
          must open. The feasting must make way for working.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          But Po Wu does this with a <strong>celebratory push</strong>. By
          sweeping with intention, eating symbolic foods, and making noise,
          people actively shape their own fortune. They aren't just passively
          waiting for a good year—they're
          <strong>clearing the path for it</strong>.
