        <p class="section-text">
          Imagine stumbling upon one of the greatest archaeological discoveries
          of the 20th century while digging a well. In 1974, farmers in Shaanxi
          province, China, did just that. Their shovels struck not water, but
          the head of a clay soldier, silently buried for over 2,200 years. This
          was the beginning of the world's encounter with the Terracotta Army —
          an awe-inspiring collection of thousands of life-sized sculptures
          built to protect China's First Emperor in the afterlife.

          mind of a transformative ruler and the formidable power of ancient
          China.

          Who Were They Built For? The Story of Qin Shi Huang

        <p class="section-text">
          To understand the Terracotta Army, you must know the man who commanded
          its creation: Qin Shi Huang (259-210 BCE).

          <FeatureItem title="The First Emperor" theme="red">
            <p>
              He conquered and unified six warring states, creating the first
              centralized Chinese empire, from which the name "China" is
              derived.

            <p>
              Driven by a fear of death and a desire for eternal rule, he
              devoted immense resources to preparing for the afterlife. The
              Terracotta Army was his eternal imperial guard, meant to protect
              him and allow him to reign in the next world just as he did in
              this one.

              The army is just one part of his massive, city-sized mausoleum
              complex, which remains largely unexcavated beneath a tomb mound.
              Ancient texts describe rivers of mercury and untold treasures
              within, guarded by traps.

        <p class="section-text">
          The sheer scale is breathtaking, but the true wonder lies in the
          details.
        </p>
        <FeatureGrid>
          <FeatureItem title="Massive Scale" theme="red">
            <p>
              Three main pits house an estimated 8,000 soldiers, along with 130
              chariots, 670 horses, and non-military figures like acrobats and
              officials. Pit 1, the largest, is the size of an airplane hangar
              and holds over 6,000 infantry and chariots in precise battle
              formation.

              This is the most miraculous fact. Every single soldier has unique
              facial features, expressions, hairstyles, and armor. Some are
              young and eager, others old and wise; some stand tall, others
              kneel as archers. This suggests they were modeled after real
              soldiers in the Emperor's army.

          <FeatureItem title="Advanced Ancient Craftsmanship" theme="red">
            <p>
              The figures were created using an assembly-line process. Heads,
              torsos, arms, and legs were molded separately, then assembled and
              customized with individual details. They were originally painted
              in vibrant, lifelike colors (traces of which can still be seen on
              some newly unearthed figures).

          <FeatureItem title="Real Weapons" theme="red">
            <p>
              The army was equipped with fully functional weapons—bronze swords,
              spears, and crossbows—many of which were found still sharp and
              remarkably well-preserved thanks to advanced chrome-plating
              techniques.

          The Terracotta Army is more than a "must-see" sight; it is a profound
          encounter with human ambition, artistry, and mortality. Standing
          before these silent ranks, you are not just looking at clay, but at
          the solidified will of an emperor who shaped a nation and sought to
          defy time itself. It is, without doubt, one of the most powerful and
          evocative relics any traveler can experience.
